# Stylometric Analyser
 5133 Assignment3

**Stylometry**

Stylometry is an application of statistical methods for linguistic style analysis. It is often used to
attribute authorship to anonymous or disputed works (often in written language) based on the
linguistic behaviours or characteristics manifested in the texts. One of the classic authorship
attribution studies was whether William Shakespeare wrote all his works, in particular one of his
popular plays — Henry VI Trilogy — was highly disputed to have been written or co-authored
by Christopher Marlowe.

In this assignment, you will implement a simple stylometric analyser to investigate the linguistic
behaviours of both authors. The analyser is able to perform basic statistical analysis
on a number of linguistic features and also present the analysis results using some form of
visualisation.

**The Dataset**

For the purpose of this assignment, six specific written works were selected from a public
available corpus1 — two of which where the authorship was attributed to the specific author;
and two other works which were known to be disputed between the two authors (but were
attributed to Shakespeare). Table 1 presents the title of each work and the corresponding file
name.
